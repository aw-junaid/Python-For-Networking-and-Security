Accessing the Nessus API with Python involves making HTTP requests to the Nessus server and handling the responses. Nessus provides a RESTful API that allows you to automate various tasks. Here's a basic example using the `requests` library in Python:

## Step 1: Install the `requests` Library

You can install the `requests` library using pip if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install requests
```

### Step 2: Write a Python Script

Create a Python script to interact with the Nessus API. Replace the placeholders with your Nessus server information and API keys.

```python
import requests
from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth

# Nessus server configuration
NESSUS_URL = 'https://your-nessus-server'
NESSUS_USERNAME = 'your-username'
NESSUS_PASSWORD = 'your-password'
NESSUS_ACCESS_KEY = 'your-access-key'
NESSUS_SECRET_KEY = 'your-secret-key'

# API endpoints
TOKEN_ENDPOINT = '/session'
SCANS_ENDPOINT = '/scans'

# Get Nessus authentication token
auth_response = requests.post(
    f'{NESSUS_URL}{TOKEN_ENDPOINT}',
    auth=HTTPBasicAuth(NESSUS_ACCESS_KEY, NESSUS_SECRET_KEY),
    verify=False  # Only disable SSL verification for testing purposes
)

if auth_response.status_code != 200:
    print(f"Authentication failed: {auth_response.text}")
    exit()

token = auth_response.json()['token']

# Example: Get list of scans
headers = {
    'X-ApiKeys': f'accessKey={NESSUS_ACCESS_KEY}; secretKey={NESSUS_SECRET_KEY}',
    'X-Cookie': f'token={token}',
}

scans_response = requests.get(f'{NESSUS_URL}{SCANS_ENDPOINT}', headers=headers, verify=False)

if scans_response.status_code == 200:
    scans = scans_response.json()['scans']
    for scan in scans:
        print(f"Scan ID: {scan['id']}, Name: {scan['name']}")
else:
    print(f"Failed to retrieve scans: {scans_response.text}")
```

### Important Notes:

- The script uses the `requests` library to make HTTP requests. You may need to adjust the script according to the specific tasks you want to perform using the Nessus API.

- Always replace placeholder values with your actual Nessus server information and API keys.

- The script disables SSL verification using `verify=False` for simplicity. In a production environment, it's crucial to handle SSL verification appropriately.

- Nessus API documentation: Make sure to refer to the official Nessus API documentation for details on available endpoints and request/response formats.

- Authentication: The example demonstrates obtaining a token using API keys. Depending on your Nessus configuration, you might need to use other authentication methods.

- Error handling: Add appropriate error handling and logging for production use.

Remember to use this script responsibly and ensure that your actions comply with the terms of service and any applicable laws and regulations.
