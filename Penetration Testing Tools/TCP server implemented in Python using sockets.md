This code is a basic example of a TCP server implemented in Python using sockets. The server listens for incoming connections on a specified IP address and port, and for each connection, it creates a new thread to handle the communication with the connected client. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

```python
import socket
import threading

# Define the IP address and port to bind the server to
bind_ip = "0.0.0.0"  # Listen on all available interfaces
bind_port = 9999

# Create a TCP socket
server = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

# Bind the socket to the specified IP address and port
server.bind((bind_ip, bind_port))

# Set the server to listen for incoming connections with a backlog of 5
server.listen(5)

# Print a message indicating that the server is listening
print("[*] Listening on %s:%d" % (bind_ip, bind_port))


# Define a function to handle communication with a connected client
def handle_client(client_socket):
    # Receive data from the client (up to 1024 bytes)
    request = client_socket.recv(1024)

    # Print the received data
    print("[*] Received: %s" % request)

    # Send a simple response back to the client
    client_socket.send(b"ACK!")

    # Print the peer's address (client's address)
    print(client_socket.getpeername())

    # Close the client socket
    client_socket.close()


# Main loop to accept incoming connections
while True:
    # Accept a connection and get the client socket and address
    client, addr = server.accept()

    # Print a message indicating the accepted connection
    print("[*] Accepted connection from: %s:%d" % (addr[0], addr[1]))

    # Create a new thread to handle the client
    client_handler = threading.Thread(target=handle_client, args=(client,))
    client_handler.start()
```

Explanation:

1. **Socket Creation and Binding:**
    - The server creates a TCP socket using `socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)`.
    - The socket is bound to the specified IP address (`0.0.0.0`, which means it listens on all available interfaces) and port (`9999`) using `server.bind((bind_ip, bind_port))`.

2. **Listening for Incoming Connections:**
    - The server listens for incoming connections with a backlog of 5 using `server.listen(5)`.

3. **Handling Client Connections:**
    - In an infinite loop (`while True`), the server accepts incoming connections with `server.accept()`.
    - For each accepted connection, it prints a message and creates a new thread (`client_handler`) to handle communication with the connected client.

4. **Handling Client Data in a Thread:**
    - The `handle_client` function is responsible for handling communication with a connected client.
    - It receives data from the client using `client_socket.recv(1024)`.
    - It prints the received data and sends a simple acknowledgment back to the client using `client_socket.send(b"ACK!")`.
    - It prints the peer's address (client's address) using `client_socket.getpeername()`.
    - It closes the client socket.

5. **Thread Creation:**
    - Each time a connection is accepted, a new thread (`client_handler`) is created to handle that specific client using `threading.Thread(target=handle_client, args=(client,))`.
    - The thread is started with `client_handler.start()`.

This server is a simple demonstration and lacks error handling and additional features that might be necessary in a production environment. The use of threading allows the server to handle multiple clients concurrently. Keep in mind that for production use, more sophisticated mechanisms like a thread pool or an asynchronous approach may be considered.
