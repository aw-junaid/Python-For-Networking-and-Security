### Purpose of the Code
The provided Python script is designed to download an image file (Python logo) from a given URL using two different methods: `urllib.request.urlretrieve` and `urllib.request.urlopen`. It saves the downloaded image as "python.png."

### Import Statement
```python
import urllib.request
```
- **Import Statement:** Imports the `urllib.request` module for handling URL-related operations.

### Starting the Download
```python
print("starting download....")
```
- **Print Statement:** Displays a message indicating the start of the download process.

### URL for Image Download
```python
url = "https://www.python.org/static/img/python-logo.png"
```
- **URL Definition:** Specifies the URL of the image file (Python logo) to be downloaded.

### Downloading with `urllib.request.urlretrieve`
```python
# download file with urlretrieve
urllib.request.urlretrieve(url, "python.png")
```
- **Downloading with `urlretrieve`:**
  - Uses `urllib.request.urlretrieve` to download the image file.
  - Saves the downloaded file as "python.png."

### Downloading with `urllib.request.urlopen`
```python
# download file with urlopen
with urllib.request.urlopen(url) as response:
    print("Status:", response.status)
    print("Downloading python.png")
    with open("python.png", "wb") as image:
        image.write(response.read())
```
- **Downloading with `urlopen`:**
  - Uses `urllib.request.urlopen` to open the URL and get the response.
  - Prints the HTTP status of the response.
  - Reads the content of the response and writes it to a local file ("python.png") in binary mode (`"wb"`).

### Summary
The script demonstrates two methods for downloading an image file from a URL using the `urllib.request` module. It first uses `urlretrieve` to directly download and save the image, and then it uses `urlopen` to open the URL, read the content, and save it to a local file. The script is a basic example of downloading files from the web in Python.
