### Code Explanation: HTTP Digest Authentication with Python

Let's break down the provided Python code, which demonstrates the use of HTTP Digest Authentication to make a request to a protected endpoint using the `requests` library.

### Importing Required Modules
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import requests
from requests.auth import HTTPDigestAuth
from getpass import getpass
```
- **Import Statements:**
  - Imports the necessary modules for making HTTP requests (`requests`), handling HTTP Digest Authentication (`HTTPDigestAuth`), and securely inputting the password (`getpass`).

### Getting User Input for Credentials
```python
user = input("Enter user:")
password = getpass()
```
- **User Input:**
  - Prompts the user to enter their username (`user`) and securely inputs the password using `getpass()`.

### Making a Request to a URL with HTTP Digest Authentication
```python
url = 'http://httpbin.org/digest-auth/auth/user/pass'
response = requests.get(url, auth=HTTPDigestAuth(user, password))
```
- **HTTP GET Request:**
  - Uses the `requests.get` function to make a GET request to the specified URL (`url`).
  - Includes HTTP Digest Authentication with the provided username and password.

### Printing Request Headers
```python
print("Headers request : ")
for header, value in response.request.headers.items():
    print(header, '-->', value)
```
- **Request Headers:**
  - Prints the headers sent in the HTTP request.

### Handling the Response
```python
print('Response.status_code:' + str(response.status_code))
if response.status_code == 200:
    print('Login successful: ' + str(response.json()))

    print("Headers response: ")
    for header, value in response.headers.items():
        print(header, '-->', value)
```
- **Response Handling:**
  - Prints the HTTP status code of the response.
  - Checks if the status code is 200 (OK), indicating a successful login.
  - If successful, prints the response content, which may contain information, and the headers of the response.

### Summary
The code demonstrates a simple command-line program where the user enters their username and password securely. It then uses HTTP Digest Authentication to make a request to a protected endpoint (`'http://httpbin.org/digest-auth/auth/user/pass'`). The response status code, response content, and response headers are printed. The use of `getpass` ensures that the password is not echoed to the terminal for security reasons.
