The code you provided demonstrates another security vulnerability related to the `pickle` module. Similar to the previous example, it involves the use of the `__reduce__` method to execute arbitrary code during deserialization. Let's break down the code and explain the security issue:

```python
import os
import pickle
from contextlib import contextmanager

class ShellSystemChroot(object):
    def __reduce__(self):
        # This will list contents of the root / folder
        return (os.system, ('ls /',))

@contextmanager
def system_chroot():
    """A simple chroot"""
    os.chroot('/')
    yield

def serialize():
    with system_chroot():
        shellcode = pickle.dumps(ShellSystemChroot())
    return shellcode

def deserialize(exploit_code):
    with system_chroot():
        pickle.loads(exploit_code)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    shellcode = serialize()
    print('Obtaining files...')
    deserialize(shellcode)
```

### Explanation:

1. **`ShellSystemChroot` Class:**
   - Similar to the previous example, the `ShellSystemChroot` class defines a `__reduce__` method. This method returns a tuple `(os.system, ('ls /',))`, indicating that when an instance of this class is pickled and later unpickled, it will execute the `os.system('ls /')` command, listing the contents of the root `/` folder.

2. **`system_chroot` Context Manager:**
   - The `system_chroot` function is a context manager that uses `os.chroot('/')` to change the root directory to `/` temporarily. This context manager is used during both serialization and deserialization to create a chroot environment.

3. **`serialize` Function:**
   - The `serialize` function uses the `system_chroot` context manager during the pickling process to create a chroot environment. It then serializes an instance of the `ShellSystemChroot` class.

4. **`deserialize` Function:**
   - The `deserialize` function uses the `system_chroot` context manager during the unpickling process to create a chroot environment. It then attempts to deserialize the provided exploit code using `pickle.loads`.

5. **`if __name__ == '__main__':` Block:**
   - In the main block, the `serialize` function is called to obtain the serialized shellcode. The shellcode is then deserialized using the `deserialize` function, resulting in the execution of the `os.system('ls /')` command within a chroot environment.

### Security Issue:

This code exhibits a security vulnerability known as arbitrary code execution during deserialization, similar to the previous example. The use of the `__reduce__` method allows an attacker to inject arbitrary code that gets executed when the object is deserialized. In this case, it executes a potentially harmful command (`ls /`) within a chroot environment.

### Mitigation:

To address this issue, you should follow similar mitigation strategies as mentioned in the previous example:

- Avoid defining `__reduce__` methods unless absolutely necessary.
- Sanitize and validate input to prevent code injection.
- Use safer serialization alternatives if possible.
- Restrict permissions appropriately when dealing with serialization or deserialization.

Additionally, if you need to use `pickle` for serialization, consider using a whitelist of allowed classes or functions and carefully validating the input data. Always exercise caution when working with code that can execute arbitrary commands, especially when dealing with untrusted data.
