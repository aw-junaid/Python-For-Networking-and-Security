Certainly! Let's go through each line of the code in detail:

### Import Statements
```python
import socket
import sys
from datetime import datetime
import errno
```
These statements import necessary modules:
- `socket`: Provides low-level networking functionality.
- `sys`: Allows access to some variables used or maintained by the interpreter.
- `datetime`: Used for working with dates and times.
- `errno`: Provides symbolic error codes and names.

### User Input
```python
remoteServer = input("Enter a remote host to scan: ")
remoteServerIP = socket.gethostbyname(remoteServer)
```
1. **User Prompt:** Asks the user to enter the hostname of the remote server they want to scan.
2. **Hostname to IP Conversion:** Uses `socket.gethostbyname()` to convert the entered hostname into an IP address.

### Port Range Input
```python
startPort = input("Enter a start port: ")
endPort = input("Enter an end port: ")
```
1. **User Prompts:** Asks the user to enter the start and end ports of the range they want to scan.

### Port Scanning Process
```python
time_init = datetime.now()

try:
    for port in range(int(startPort), int(endPort)):
        # ...
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    # ...
except socket.gaierror:
    # ...
except socket.error:
    # ...
```
1. **Time Initialization:** Records the current time before starting the port scanning loop.
2. **Port Scanning Loop:** Iterates through the range of ports specified by the user.
    - A socket is created (`sock`).
    - `socket.connect_ex()` is used to attempt a connection to the current port on the remote server.
    - If the connection is successful (result == 0), it prints that the port is open. Otherwise, it prints that the port is closed along with an associated reason (if any).
    - The socket is closed after each iteration.

### Exception Handling
```python
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    # ...
except socket.gaierror:
    # ...
except socket.error:
    # ...
```
1. **KeyboardInterrupt:** Handles the case where the user interrupts the scanning process with Ctrl+C. Prints a message and exits the script.
2. **socket.gaierror:** Handles errors related to hostname resolution. Prints an error message and exits.
3. **socket.error:** Catches general socket errors. Prints an error message and exits.

### Time Measurement
```python
time_finish = datetime.now()
total = time_finish - time_init
print('Port Scanning Completed in: ', total)
```
1. **Time Calculation:** Measures the time taken for the entire port scanning process.
2. **Prints Result:** Displays the total time taken for the scan.

### Summary
The script takes user input for the remote host and port range, attempts to connect to each port in the specified range on the remote host, reports whether each port is open or closed, along with a reason for closure. It includes exception handling for potential errors and prints the total time taken for the scan.
