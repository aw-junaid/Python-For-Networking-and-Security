     - Integrates with other security tools, SIEMs (Security Information and Event Management), and platforms for better visibility and response.

**3. Scanning Process:**

   - **Pre-Scan Configuration:**
     - Define scanning policies, set target hosts, configure scan options, and schedule scans.

   - **Scan Execution:**
     - Nessus initiates the scan, leveraging its plugin library to probe for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.

   - **Vulnerability Detection:**
     - Actively identifies vulnerabilities by probing target systems and comparing results to the CVE database.

   - **Severity Scoring:**
     - Assigns severity scores to vulnerabilities based on factors like exploitability and potential impact.

   - **Report Generation:**
     - Generates detailed reports with identified vulnerabilities, risk scores, and recommended remediation steps.

**4. Use Cases:**

   - **Regular Vulnerability Assessments:**
     - Conduct routine scans to identify and remediate vulnerabilities proactively.

   - **Compliance Auditing:**
