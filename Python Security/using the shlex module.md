The `shlex` module in Python provides a way to parse strings into a list of shell-style words. It is often used to properly quote and escape strings when constructing commands for subprocess execution, helping to prevent shell injection vulnerabilities.

Here's an example of how you can use the `shlex.quote` function to sanitize and quote a user-provided input before using it in a subprocess command:

```python
import subprocess
import shlex

def ping_secure_with_shlex(myserver):
    # Sanitize and quote the input using shlex.quote
    sanitized_server = shlex.quote(myserver)
    
    # Construct the command with sanitized input
    command_arguments = ['ping', '-c', '1', sanitized_server]
    
    # Execute the command with subprocess.Popen
    return subprocess.Popen(command_arguments, shell=False)

# Example usage
print(ping_secure_with_shlex('8.8.8.8'))
```

In this example:

1. The `shlex.quote` function is used to sanitize and quote the `myserver` input. This ensures that the input is properly escaped and quoted, making it safe for use in a subprocess command.

2. The sanitized input is then used to construct the command as a list of arguments, which is a more secure practice than passing a single string to the shell.

3. The `subprocess.Popen` function is called with `shell=False` to execute the command without involving a shell, reducing the risk of shell injection.

Using `shlex.quote` is a good practice when dealing with user-provided input or any input that may be potentially unsafe. It helps prevent unintended shell interpretation of special characters and ensures that the input is treated as a single argument in the subprocess command.
