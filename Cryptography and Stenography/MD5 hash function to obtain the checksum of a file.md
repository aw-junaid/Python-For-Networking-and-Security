This Python script calculates the MD5 checksum of a file using the `Crypto.Hash` module from the Pycryptodome library. The MD5 checksum is a 128-bit hash value commonly used for data integrity verification. Here's an explanation of the code:

```python
from Crypto.Hash import MD5

def get_file_checksum(filename):
    # Create an MD5 hash object
    hash = MD5.new()
    
    # Define the chunk size for reading the file in chunks
    chunk_size = 8191
    
    # Open the file in binary mode for reading
    with open(filename, 'rb') as file:
        # Read the file in chunks and update the hash object
        while True:
            chunk = file.read(chunk_size)
            if len(chunk) == 0:
                break
            hash.update(chunk)
            
    # Return the hexadecimal representation of the MD5 hash
    return hash.hexdigest()

# Print the MD5 checksum of the specified file
print('The MD5 checksum is', get_file_checksum('checksSumFile.py'))
```

Explanation:

1. **Importing the MD5 Module:**
   - The script imports the MD5 module from the `Crypto.Hash` package provided by the Pycryptodome library.

2. **`get_file_checksum` Function:**
   - The function takes a `filename` as an input parameter.
   - It creates an MD5 hash object using `MD5.new()`.

3. **Calculating the MD5 Checksum:**
   - The script reads the file in chunks defined by `chunk_size` (in this case, 8191 bytes).
   - It updates the MD5 hash object with each chunk using the `update` method.

4. **Hexadecimal Digest:**
   - The function returns the hexadecimal representation of the MD5 hash using the `hexdigest()` method.

5. **Usage Example:**
   - The script then prints the MD5 checksum of the specified file (`checksSumFile.py` in this case).

6. **Note:**
   - The `with` statement is used to open the file. It ensures that the file is properly closed after reading, even if an exception occurs during the reading process.

7. **Indentation and Looping:**
   - Pay attention to the indentation of the `return` statement. The `return` statement should be outside the `while` loop to ensure that the entire file is read before returning the checksum.

In summary, this script calculates and prints the MD5 checksum of a specified file using Pycryptodome's MD5 module.
