Steganography is the practice of concealing information within other non-secret data to avoid detection. The goal of steganography is to hide the existence of information rather than its content. This can be contrasted with cryptography, where the goal is to secure the content of a message but not necessarily to conceal its existence.

Here are key concepts related to steganography:

1. **Carrier Medium:**
   - The carrier medium is the data in which the secret information is hidden. This could be an image, audio file, video, text, or any other form of digital or analog data.

2. **Stego Object:**
   - The stego object is the carrier medium after the secret information has been embedded. It appears unchanged to casual observers but contains hidden data.

3. **Payload:**
   - The payload is the actual secret information that needs to be concealed. This could be text, an image, a file, or any form of data.

4. **Embedding/Encoding:**
   - The process of hiding the payload within the carrier medium is known as embedding or encoding. Different techniques are used depending on the type of carrier medium.

5. **Extraction/Decoding:**
   - The process of retrieving the hidden information from the stego object is known as extraction or decoding. This is typically done using a specific algorithm or tool.

6. **Types of Steganography:**
   - **Image Steganography:** Concealing information within images. Common methods include LSB (Least Significant Bit) substitution.
   - **Audio Steganography:** Hiding data within audio files, often imperceptible to the human ear.
   - **Video Steganography:** Embedding information within video files.
   - **Text Steganography:** Concealing text within other text, perhaps by using specific fonts or characters.

7. **Tools and Techniques:**
   - Various tools and software are available for steganography, allowing users to easily embed and extract hidden information. Techniques may involve modifying pixel values, altering audio frequencies, or manipulating other characteristics of the carrier medium.

8. **Security and Detection:**
   - Steganalysis is the process of detecting and analyzing the use of steganography. Security measures aim to prevent unauthorized access to the hidden information.

9. **Applications:**
   - Steganography has both legitimate and malicious use cases. It is employed for secure communication, watermarking, copyright protection, and can also be used for malicious purposes such as hiding malware.

Steganography is a continually evolving field, with researchers developing new techniques and methods to hide and detect information. It plays a role in both information security and digital forensics.
