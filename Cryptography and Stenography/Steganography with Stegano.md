Stegano is a versatile Python library for **image steganography**, offering features to hide and reveal secret messages within image files. Here's a breakdown of its functionalities and a brief guide to get you started:

**Stegano Capabilities:**

* **Text Hiding:** Embed plaintext messages within images using LSB (Least Significant Bit) steganography.
* **File Hiding:** Conceal files of any format within images.
* **Password Protection:** Encrypt hidden information with a password for added security.
* **Multiple Image Formats:** Supports various image formats like PNG, JPEG, BMP, and more.
* **Command-Line Interface:** Easy to use through command-line commands for encryption and decryption.

**Using Stegano:**

1. **Installation:** Ensure you have Python and Stegano installed: `pip install stegano`

2. **Hiding a Message:**

```python
# Hide text message "This is a secret!" in image "photo.jpg" with password "mypassword"
stegano -e -p mypassword -m "This is a secret!" photo.jpg secret_photo.jpg
```

3. **Revealing the Message:**

```python
# Extract hidden message from "secret_photo.jpg" using password "mypassword"
stegano -d -p mypassword secret_photo.jpg
```

4. **Hiding a File:**

```python
# Hide file "secret_file.txt" in image "cover.jpg" with no password
stegano -ef cover.jpg secret_file.txt stego_image.jpg
```

5. **Extracting a File:**

```python
# Extract hidden file from "stego_image.jpg"
stegano -df stego_image.jpg extracted_file.txt
```

**Additional Notes:**

* Image quality may slightly degrade after embedding data, depending on the size of the hidden information.
* Stegano works best with larger, complex images containing more redundant data for hiding bits.
* Consider password complexity and security practices when using password protection.
* Remember, steganography is not a foolproof security measure. Advanced steganalysis techniques may be able to detect hidden messages.
