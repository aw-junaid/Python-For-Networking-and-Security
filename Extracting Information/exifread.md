The provided Python script uses the `exifread` library to read and print EXIF (Exchangeable Image File Format) metadata from an image file. Here's an explanation of the code:

```python
import exifread

# Open the image file in binary mode
file = open('images/image.jpg', 'rb')

# Process the EXIF tags from the image file
tags = exifread.process_file(file)

# Iterate through the tags and print key-value pairs
for tag in tags.keys():
    print("Key: %s, value: %s" % (tag, tags[tag]))
```

Explanation:

1. **Importing the `exifread` Module:**
   - `import exifread`: Import the `exifread` module, which provides functions for reading EXIF metadata from image files.

2. **Opening the Image File:**
   - `file = open('images/image.jpg', 'rb')`: Open the image file ('images/image.jpg') in binary mode (`'rb'`). This allows reading the file as binary data.

3. **Processing EXIF Tags:**
   - `tags = exifread.process_file(file)`: Use the `process_file` function from `exifread` to read and process EXIF tags from the opened image file. The result is a dictionary (`tags`) where keys are tag names, and values are the corresponding tag values.

4. **Iterating and Printing Key-Value Pairs:**
   - `for tag in tags.keys():`: Iterate through the keys of the `tags` dictionary, which represent EXIF tags.
   - `print("Key: %s, value: %s" % (tag, tags[tag]))`: Print each key-value pair in a formatted string. The `%s` placeholders are replaced with the tag name (`tag`) and its corresponding value (`tags[tag]`).

5. **Note:**
   - EXIF tags contain information such as camera settings, date and time, GPS coordinates, and more.
   - The script assumes that the image file ('images/image.jpg') exists. Adjust the file path as needed.
   - Ensure that you have the `exifread` library installed (`pip install exifread`) before running the script.

This script is useful for quickly inspecting the EXIF metadata of an image file. It provides insights into the settings and conditions under which the photo was taken.
