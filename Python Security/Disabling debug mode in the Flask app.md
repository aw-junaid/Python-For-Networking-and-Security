In Flask, the debug mode is enabled by default when you run the development server using `app.run()`. While the debug mode is useful during development for automatic reloading and displaying detailed error messages, it should be disabled in a production environment for security reasons. Debug mode can expose sensitive information and create security vulnerabilities.

To disable the debug mode in a Flask application, you need to set the `debug` attribute of the Flask app object to `False`. Here's an example:

```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

# Your routes and other configurations go here

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Disable debug mode when running the app
    app.debug = False
    app.run()
```

When the Flask application is run with `app.run()`, the `debug` attribute is set to `False` to ensure that the application is not running in debug mode. It's important to set the `debug` attribute to `False` explicitly, especially in a production environment, to avoid potential security risks associated with debug mode.

You can also specify the `debug` parameter directly in the `app.run()` method:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=False)
```

By setting `debug` to `False`, you ensure that the Flask application runs in a more secure mode suitable for production deployments. Always remember to disable debug mode when deploying Flask applications to production servers.
