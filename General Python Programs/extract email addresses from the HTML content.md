### Purpose of the Code
The provided Python script aims to fetch and extract email addresses from the HTML content of a given URL. It sets a custom user agent, makes an HTTP request to the specified URL, retrieves the HTML content, and then uses a regular expression to find and print email addresses present in the HTML.

### Import Statements
```python
import urllib.request
import re
```
- **Import Statements:** Import the required modules (`urllib.request` for handling HTTP requests and `re` for regular expressions).

### User Agent and URL Input
```python
USER_AGENT = 'Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 10) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/83.0.4103.101 Mobile Safari/537.36'

url =  input("Enter url:http://")
```
- **User Agent Definition:** Specifies a custom user agent string mimicking Chrome on Android.
- **URL Input:** Takes user input for the URL, prefixed with "http://".

### Custom Opener with User Agent
```python
opener = urllib.request.build_opener()
opener.addheaders = [('User-agent', USER_AGENT)]
urllib.request.install_opener(opener)
```
- **Custom Opener Setup:** Creates an opener with the specified user agent and installs it globally.

### HTTP Request to the Given URL
```python
response = urllib.request.urlopen('http://'+url)
html_content= response.read()
```
- **HTTP Request:** Opens the URL with the specified user agent and reads the HTML content from the response.

### Regular Expression Pattern
```python
pattern = re.compile("[-a-zA-Z0-9._]+[-a-zA-Z0-9._]+@[-a-zA-Z0-9_]+.[a-zA-Z0-9_.]+")
mails = re.findall(pattern, str(html_content))
```
- **Regular Expression Pattern:** Defines a regular expression pattern to match email addresses in the HTML content.
- **Finding Email Addresses:** Uses `re.findall()` to find all matches of the pattern in the HTML content.

### Printing Extracted Email Addresses
```python
print(mails)
```
- **Printing:** Prints the list of email addresses extracted from the HTML content.

### Summary
This script is designed to extract email addresses from the HTML content of a given URL. It sets a custom user agent, performs an HTTP request, retrieves the HTML, applies a regular expression pattern to identify email addresses, and finally prints the extracted email addresses. Keep in mind that using regular expressions for parsing HTML can be fragile, and more robust solutions like HTML parsers are recommended for complex scenarios.
