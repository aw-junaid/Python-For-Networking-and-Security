OpenVAS (Open Vulnerability Assessment System) is a powerful open-source vulnerability scanner. The installation steps can vary slightly depending on the Linux distribution you are using. Below are general instructions for installing OpenVAS on Ubuntu, which is a widely used Linux distribution.

### Install OpenVAS on Ubuntu:

1. **Update Package Lists:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   ```

2. **Install Required Packages:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install -y openvas9
   ```

3. **Initialize OpenVAS:**
   ```bash
   sudo openvas-setup
   ```

   Follow the prompts during the setup to configure OpenVAS. This process may take some time as it downloads and installs various components.

4. **Start OpenVAS:**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start openvas-scanner
   sudo systemctl start openvas-manager
   sudo systemctl start openvas-gsa
   ```

5. **Enable OpenVAS Services to Start on Boot:**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable openvas-scanner
   sudo systemctl enable openvas-manager
   sudo systemctl enable openvas-gsa
   ```

6. **Access OpenVAS Web Interface:**
   Open a web browser and go to `https://localhost:4000` (or replace `localhost` with the IP address of your server). The default login credentials are:
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `admin`

   Change the password immediately after the first login.

7. **Update NVTs (Network Vulnerability Tests):**
   After the initial setup, it's essential to update the NVTs to ensure the scanner has the latest vulnerability information.
   ```bash
   sudo openvas-feed-update
   sudo openvas-nvt-sync
   sudo openvas-scapdata-sync
   sudo openvas-certdata-sync
   ```

### Notes:

- The setup process might prompt you to configure various settings. Follow the on-screen instructions.

- Ensure that your server has sufficient resources (CPU, RAM) to run OpenVAS effectively.

- The default setup uses self-signed SSL certificates. For a production environment, you might consider replacing them with valid certificates.

- Remember to keep OpenVAS and its NVTs up to date for accurate vulnerability scanning.

These instructions are tailored for Ubuntu. If you are using a different Linux distribution, the package manager and specific package names may vary. Always refer to the official documentation or community resources for your specific distribution for the most accurate information.
