Here is a general guide on how you might approach installing a Python module from GitHub:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/nessrest.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Repository:**
   ```bash
   cd nessrest
   ```

3. **Install the Module:**
   ```bash
   python setup.py install
   ```

4. **Check for Dependencies:**
   The repository may have listed dependencies in the README or installation instructions. Ensure you have those dependencies installed.

5. **Review Documentation:**
   Look for documentation within the repository, especially a README file. It often contains information on how to use the module.

Keep in mind that using third-party modules, especially those not widely recognized or officially supported, comes with risks. Ensure that the repository is maintained, well-documented, and has an active community. Additionally, always review the code before incorporating it into your projects, especially if it involves security-related tasks.

If you provide a specific link or context, I might be able to offer more tailored assistance. Alternatively, you could explore alternative libraries like `pyTenable` or others that are well-documented and widely used in the community for interacting with Nessus or Tenable.io APIs.
