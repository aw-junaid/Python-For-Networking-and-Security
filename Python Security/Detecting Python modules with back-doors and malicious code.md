Detecting Python modules with backdoors or malicious code can be challenging, but there are several strategies and tools you can use to enhance the security of your Python codebase. Here are some recommendations:

### 1. **Code Review:**
   - Regularly perform thorough code reviews of your Python codebase. This includes both your team's code and third-party libraries. Look for suspicious or obfuscated code, unauthorized access, and any indications of backdoors.

### 2. **Static Code Analysis:**
   - Use static code analysis tools to automatically scan your code for potential security issues. For Python, tools like Bandit, Pylint, and safety-check can help identify common security vulnerabilities.

   ```bash
   # Example usage of Bandit
   bandit -r /path/to/your/code
   ```

   ```bash
   # Example usage of safety-check (checks for insecure dependencies)
   safety check
   ```

### 3. **Dependency Scanning:**
   - Regularly scan your project's dependencies for known security vulnerabilities. Tools like `safety` and `bandit` can also be used for checking dependencies.

   ```bash
   # Example usage of safety-check for checking dependencies
   safety check --full-report
   ```

### 4. **Use Trusted Sources:**
   - Only use well-known and reputable sources for third-party Python modules. Prefer using packages from the official Python Package Index (PyPI) or other trusted repositories.

### 5. **Code Signing:**
   - When possible, use code signing for Python packages. Code signing helps verify the authenticity and integrity of the code.

### 6. **Monitoring and Anomaly Detection:**
   - Implement monitoring and anomaly detection systems to identify unusual patterns or behaviors in your application. This can help detect unexpected network activities or unauthorized access.

### 7. **File Integrity Monitoring:**
   - Set up file integrity monitoring to detect changes to critical files in your codebase. Any unexpected modification to files could be a sign of malicious activity.

### 8. **Automated Security Checks in CI/CD:**
   - Integrate automated security checks into your continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. This ensures that security checks are performed automatically with each build.

### 9. **Security Audits:**
   - Conduct security audits regularly to assess the overall security of your codebase. This may include both automated tools and manual inspection by security experts.

### 10. **Use Virtual Environments:**
   - Use virtual environments to isolate dependencies and minimize the impact of potentially vulnerable or malicious modules.

### 11. **Community Feedback:**
   - Stay informed about security discussions in the Python community. Platforms like the Python Security mailing list and forums can provide valuable insights into potential security threats.

### 12. **Keep Software Updated:**
   - Regularly update your Python interpreter, dependencies, and tools to benefit from security patches and improvements.

### 13. **Behavioral Analysis:**
   - Monitor the runtime behavior of your application for unexpected or malicious activities. Tools like runtime application self-protection (RASP) solutions can help with this.

### 14. **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):**
   - Implement a SIEM system to collect and analyze log data for security events. This can help detect and respond to security incidents.

### 15. **Community Recommendations:**
   - Leverage recommendations and insights from the Python community regarding the security of specific modules. Community feedback can be valuable in identifying potential risks.

Remember that security is an ongoing process, and it's essential to stay vigilant, conduct regular security assessments, and follow best practices to minimize the risk of malicious code in your Python projects.
