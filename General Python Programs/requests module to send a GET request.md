### Purpose of the Code
The provided Python script uses the `requests` module to send a GET request to a specified URL (hostname) and then prints information about the response, including the JSON content, status code, response headers, and request headers.

### Import Statements
```python
import requests
import json
```
- **Import Statements:** Import the `requests` module for making HTTP requests and the `json` module for handling JSON data.

### User Input
```python
domain = input("Enter the hostname http://")
```
- **User Input:** Takes user input for the hostname (URL) with a prefix of "http://".

### Sending a GET Request
```python
response = requests.get("http://" + domain)
```
- **GET Request:** Uses the `requests.get` method to send a GET request to the specified URL.

### Printing JSON Content
```python
print(response.json)
```
- **Printing JSON Content:** Attempts to print the JSON content of the response. However, there is a mistake in the code (`response.json` should be `response.json()`), and this part may not work correctly.

### Printing Status Code
```python
print("Status code: " + str(response.status_code))
```
- **Printing Status Code:** Prints the HTTP status code of the response.

### Printing Response Headers
```python
print("Headers response: ")
for header, value in response.headers.items():
    print(header, '-->', value)
```
- **Printing Response Headers:** Loops through the headers of the response and prints each header along with its value.

### Printing Request Headers
```python
print("Headers request : ")
for header, value in response.request.headers.items():
    print(header, '-->', value)
```
- **Printing Request Headers:** Loops through the headers of the original request and prints each header along with its value.

### Summary
The script takes user input for a hostname, sends a GET request to the specified URL using the `requests` module, and prints information about the response, including the JSON content (if corrected), status code, response headers, and request headers. The code provides insights into the communication between the client and the server for the given URL.
