### Code Explanation:

The provided code defines a function `ping_secure` that uses the `subprocess.Popen` function to execute a secure ping command. The key improvement is that it passes the command and its arguments as a list, avoiding the use of `shell=True` and reducing the risk of command injection. Let's break down the code and discuss the improvements:

```python
import subprocess

def ping_secure(myserver):
    command_arguments = ['ping', '-c', '1', myserver]
    return subprocess.Popen(command_arguments, shell=False)

print(ping_secure('8.8.8.8'))
```

1. **`ping_secure` Function:**
   - The `ping_secure` function takes a single argument, `myserver`, representing the target server to ping.
   - It constructs the command and its arguments as a list (`['ping', '-c', '1', myserver]`).

2. **`subprocess.Popen` with `shell=False`:**
   - The `subprocess.Popen` call uses `shell=False`, indicating that the command should be executed without involving a shell.
   - The command and its arguments are provided as a list, which reduces the risk of command injection.

3. **Security Improvements:**
   - By passing the command and its arguments as a list, the code avoids the use of `shell=True`, making it more secure against command injection vulnerabilities.

4. **Example of a Secure Command:**
   - The example provided (`'8.8.8.8'`) is secure because it is treated as an argument to the `ping` command, and the absence of `shell=True` ensures that no additional shell processing occurs.

### Security Best Practices:

1. **Use Argument Lists:**
   - Always pass the command and its arguments as a list when using `subprocess.Popen`. This practice reduces the risk of shell injection and other security vulnerabilities.

   ```python
   command_arguments = ['ping', '-c', '1', myserver]
   subprocess.Popen(command_arguments, shell=False)
   ```

2. **Avoid `shell=True`:**
   - Only use `shell=True` when absolutely necessary, and ensure that user inputs are properly validated and sanitized to prevent command injection.

3. **Validate and Sanitize Inputs:**
   - If the `myserver` variable involves user input, validate and sanitize it before constructing the command. Consider using functions like `shlex.quote` for additional safety.

   ```python
   import shlex

   myserver = shlex.quote(myserver)
   command_arguments = ['ping', '-c', '1', myserver]
   subprocess.Popen(command_arguments, shell=False)
   ```

By following these best practices, the code becomes more resilient against security vulnerabilities related to subprocess execution and command injection. Always prioritize secure coding practices when working with subprocesses and user inputs.
