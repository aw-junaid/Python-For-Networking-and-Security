### Code Explanation: Making a GET Request with `httpx`

Let's break down the provided Python code that uses the `httpx` library to make a GET request to "http://www.google.es" and print information about the response.

### Importing the `httpx` Library
```python
import httpx
```
- **Import Statement:** Imports the `httpx` library, which provides an enhanced HTTP client for making requests.

### Creating an `httpx` Client
```python
client = httpx.Client(timeout=10.0)
```
- **Creating an `httpx` Client:**
  - Instantiates an `httpx.Client` object.
  - The `timeout` parameter is set to 10.0 seconds, specifying the maximum time the client should wait for a response.

### Making a GET Request
```python
response = client.get("http://www.google.es")
```
- **Making a GET Request:**
  - Uses the `get` method of the `httpx.Client` object to make a GET request to "http://www.google.es."
  - The response is stored in the `response` variable.

### Printing the Response Object
```python
print(response)
```
- **Printing the Response Object:**
  - Prints the entire `httpx.Response` object, which includes information about the HTTP response.

### Printing the HTTP Status Code
```python
print(response.status_code)
```
- **Printing the HTTP Status Code:**
  - Prints the HTTP status code of the response, indicating the success or failure of the request.

### Printing the Response Text
```python
print(response.text)
```
- **Printing the Response Text:**
  - Prints the content of the HTTP response as text.

### Summary
The provided code utilizes the `httpx` library to create an HTTP client, make a GET request to "http://www.google.es," and print information about the response. This includes printing the full response object, the HTTP status code, and the response content as text. The `timeout` parameter ensures that the client waits a maximum of 10 seconds for a response before timing out.
