The provided Python code defines a function `geoip(domain)` that sends a GET request to the freegeoip.app API to retrieve geolocation information for a given domain. Here's an explanation of the code:

```python
import requests

def geoip(domain):
    headers = {
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
    
    response = requests.get('http://freegeoip.app/json/' + domain, headers=headers)
    return response.text

print(geoip('python.org'))
```

Explanation:

1. **Importing `requests`:**
   - The code begins by importing the `requests` library, which is commonly used for making HTTP requests.

2. **Function `geoip(domain)`:**
   - The `geoip` function takes a single parameter `domain`, representing the domain for which geolocation information is to be retrieved.

3. **Headers:**
   - The `headers` dictionary is defined with the key "Content-Type" set to "application/json." This header is typically used to specify the media type of the resource.

4. **HTTP GET Request:**
   - The `requests.get` function is used to send a GET request to the freegeoip.app API.
   - The URL is constructed by appending the provided `domain` to the base URL: `'http://freegeoip.app/json/' + domain`.
   - The `headers` parameter is set to include the defined headers.

5. **Response Handling:**
   - The response from the API is stored in the `response` variable.
   - The function returns the content of the response as a text string using `response.text`.

6. **Usage Example:**
   - The `geoip` function is called with the domain 'python.org'.
   - The result is printed using `print(geoip('python.org'))`.

**Note:**
- The `requests.get` function is synchronous, and if the server takes a while to respond, the program may be blocked during the request.
- Ensure that you have internet access, and the freegeoip.app API is accessible from your environment when running this code.
- Be aware of the terms of use of the API and any rate limits that may apply. Additionally, note that freegeoip.app might have usage limitations or restrictions. Check their documentation for details.
