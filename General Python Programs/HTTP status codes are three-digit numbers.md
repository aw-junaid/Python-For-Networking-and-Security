HTTP status codes are three-digit numbers that provide information about the status of a request made by a client to a server. They are included in the HTTP response sent by the server to indicate whether the request was successful, encountered an error, or requires further action. Status codes are grouped into five classes, each represented by the first digit:

1. **1xx - Informational:**
   - These status codes indicate that the server has received the request and is continuing to process it.
   - Examples:
     - 100 - Continue
     - 101 - Switching Protocols

2. **2xx - Success:**
   - These status codes indicate that the request was successfully received, understood, and accepted.
   - Examples:
     - 200 - OK
     - 201 - Created
     - 204 - No Content

3. **3xx - Redirection:**
   - These status codes indicate that further action needs to be taken in order to complete the request.
   - Examples:
     - 301 - Moved Permanently
     - 302 - Found (Temporary Redirect)
     - 304 - Not Modified

4. **4xx - Client Errors:**
   - These status codes indicate that there was an error on the client's side, and the request cannot be fulfilled.
   - Examples:
     - 400 - Bad Request
     - 401 - Unauthorized
     - 404 - Not Found

5. **5xx - Server Errors:**
   - These status codes indicate that the server failed to fulfill a valid request.
   - Examples:
     - 500 - Internal Server Error
     - 503 - Service Unavailable
     - 504 - Gateway Timeout

### Common HTTP Status Codes:

- **200 OK:**
  - The request was successful, and the server has returned the requested data.

- **201 Created:**
  - The request was successful, and a new resource was created as a result.

- **204 No Content:**
  - The request was successful, but there is no data to send in the response.

- **400 Bad Request:**
  - The request could not be understood or was missing required parameters.

- **401 Unauthorized:**
  - Authentication is required, and the provided credentials are not sufficient.

- **403 Forbidden:**
  - The client does not have permission to access the requested resource.

- **404 Not Found:**
  - The requested resource could not be found on the server.

- **500 Internal Server Error:**
  - The server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.

- **503 Service Unavailable:**
  - The server is temporarily unable to handle the request (usually due to maintenance or overload).

These are just a few examples, and there are many other status codes with specific meanings. Understanding HTTP status codes is essential for diagnosing and resolving issues in web applications and services.
