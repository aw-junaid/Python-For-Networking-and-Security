Controlling user input in dynamic code evaluation is crucial to prevent security vulnerabilities such as code injection. When you need to evaluate user-provided code dynamically, consider the following best practices to enhance security:

1. **Avoid `eval()` if Possible:**
   - Whenever possible, try to avoid using `eval()` or similar functions that execute arbitrary code. There are often safer alternatives, such as using predefined functions, parsing input with libraries like `ast`, or employing other domain-specific solutions.

2. **Use Safe Alternatives:**
   - If you need to evaluate expressions, consider using safer alternatives like `ast.literal_eval()` for evaluating literals or other parsers that are designed to handle specific input formats.

   ```python
   import ast

   user_input = "42"
   result = ast.literal_eval(user_input)
   ```

3. **Whitelisting Allowed Functions:**
   - If you must allow dynamic code execution, consider using a whitelist of allowed functions or operations. Only permit specific functions that are safe for your application context.

   ```python
   allowed_functions = {'math.sqrt', 'custom_function'}

   def execute_user_code(user_input):
       if user_input in allowed_functions:
           result = eval(user_input)
           return result
       else:
           raise ValueError("Invalid function.")
   ```

4. **Restricting Imports:**
   - Limit the ability to import certain modules by providing a restricted `globals` dictionary to `eval()`.

   ```python
   restricted_globals = {'__builtins__': None, 'math': math}

   user_input = "math.sqrt(25)"
   result = eval(user_input, restricted_globals)
   ```

5. **Implement Code Reviews:**
   - If possible, have code reviews for any dynamically evaluated code. This can help catch potential security issues and ensure that the code adheres to established guidelines.

6. **Validate and Sanitize Input:**
   - Validate and sanitize user input before allowing it to be evaluated. Ensure that the input adheres to the expected format and doesn't contain malicious code.

   ```python
   import re

   def sanitize_input(user_input):
       if re.match(r'^[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$', user_input):
           return user_input
       else:
           raise ValueError("Invalid input.")
   ```

7. **Use Safe Execution Environments:**
   - Consider using sandboxing or safe execution environments to run user-provided code. Libraries like `execjs` provide a way to execute JavaScript code in a controlled environment.

Remember that allowing dynamic code execution introduces security risks, and it's essential to carefully evaluate the necessity of such functionality in your application. If possible, explore alternative approaches that provide the required flexibility without exposing your application to potential vulnerabilities.
