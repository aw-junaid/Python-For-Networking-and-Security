### **Using Stem Library to Request a New Tor Identity: Explanation**

This Python script demonstrates how to use the `stem` library to connect to the Tor control port, authenticate, and request a new identity (circuit) to change the Tor exit node.

### **1. Importing the Required Module:**
```python
from stem import Signal
from stem.control import Controller
```

The script imports the `Signal` enumeration and the `Controller` class from the `stem` library.

### **2. Connecting to Tor Control Port and Authenticating:**
```python
with Controller.from_port(port=9051) as controller:
    controller.authenticate()
```

An instance of the `Controller` class is created using a context manager to ensure proper connection handling. The script connects to the Tor control port on `localhost:9051` and authenticates with the control port.

### **3. Requesting a New Tor Identity:**
```python
    print("success!")
    controller.signal(Signal.NEWNYM)
    print("New Tor Connection processed")
```

The `signal` method is called with `Signal.NEWNYM` as an argument, which instructs Tor to establish a new identity (circuit). This action changes the Tor exit node, providing a fresh connection.

### **Explanation Summary:**
- The script uses the `stem` library to connect to the Tor control port and authenticate.
- The `signal` method is utilized to send a `NEWNYM` signal, requesting a new Tor identity.
- After successfully processing the signal, the script prints a success message and indicates that a new Tor connection has been established.

### **Note:**
Make sure to have the `stem` library installed (`pip install stem`) before running this script. Additionally, ensure that Tor is running and the control port is accessible for successful execution.
