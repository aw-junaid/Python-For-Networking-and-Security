### Purpose of the Code
The provided Python script demonstrates the use of the `http.client` module to establish an HTTP connection to "www.google.com," send a GET request, receive and analyze the response.

### Import Statement
```python
import http.client
```
- **Import Statement:** Imports the `http.client` module, which provides classes for working with the HTTP protocol.

### HTTP Connection Setup
```python
connection = http.client.HTTPConnection("www.google.com")
```
- **HTTP Connection Setup:** Creates an `HTTPConnection` object for connecting to the specified host ("www.google.com").

### Sending a GET Request
```python
connection.request("GET", "/")
```
- **Sending a GET Request:** Sends a GET request to the root ("/") path of the server.

### Getting the Response
```python
response = connection.getresponse()
```
- **Getting the Response:** Retrieves the HTTP response from the server.

### Analyzing the Response
```python
print(type(response))
print(response.status, response.reason)

if response.status == 200:
    data = response.read()
    print(data)
```
1. **Response Type Printing:** Prints the type of the response object.
2. **Status and Reason Printing:** Prints the HTTP status code and reason phrase.
3. **Data Reading (if Status is 200):** If the status code is 200 (OK), reads and prints the data from the response.

### Summary:
1. **HTTP Connection:** Establishes an HTTP connection to "www.google.com" using the `HTTPConnection` class.
2. **GET Request:** Sends a GET request to the root path ("/") of the server.
3. **Response Analysis:**
   - Prints the type, status code, and reason phrase of the HTTP response.
   - If the status code is 200, reads and prints the response data.

This script provides a basic example of making an HTTP request using the `http.client` module. Note that for more complex scenarios and higher-level functionality, you might consider using third-party libraries like `requests`.
