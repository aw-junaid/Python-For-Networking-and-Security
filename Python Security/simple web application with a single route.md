This Flask code defines a simple web application with a single route:

```python
from flask import Flask, redirect

app = Flask(__name__)

valid_locations = ['www.packtpub.com', 'valid_url']

@app.route('/redirect/<url>')
def redirect_url(url):
    sanitized_location = get_sanitized_location(url)  # secure
    print(sanitized_location)
    return redirect("http://" + sanitized_location, code=302)

def get_sanitized_location(location):
    if location in valid_locations:
        return location
    else:
        return "check url"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

Here's an explanation of the code:

1. **Flask Application Setup:**
   - `from flask import Flask, redirect`: Imports the necessary modules and functions from Flask.
   - `app = Flask(__name__)`: Creates a Flask application.

2. **Route and Redirect:**
   - `@app.route('/redirect/<url>')`: Defines a route with a dynamic parameter `<url>`. This parameter captures the value from the URL.
   - `def redirect_url(url):`: The corresponding function for the `/redirect/<url>` route. It takes the captured URL parameter.
   - `sanitized_location = get_sanitized_location(url)`: Calls the `get_sanitized_location` function to sanitize the input URL.
   - `return redirect("http://" + sanitized_location, code=302)`: Redirects the user to the sanitized URL with a status code of 302 (Found).

3. **`get_sanitized_location` Function:**
   - `def get_sanitized_location(location):`: Takes a location as input.
   - `if location in valid_locations:`: Checks if the location is in the list of valid locations.
   - `return location`: If the location is valid, it returns the original location.
   - `else:`: If the location is not valid, it returns a default value of "check url."

4. **Running the Application:**
   - `if __name__ == '__main__':`: Ensures that the Flask application is only run when the script is executed directly (not imported as a module).
   - `app.run(debug=True)`: Starts the development server with debugging enabled.

5. **Security Considerations:**
   - The code attempts to sanitize the input URL using the `get_sanitized_location` function and checks if it is in the list of valid locations before performing the redirect.
   - The `redirect` function is used with a hardcoded protocol "http://" and a status code of 302.

It's important to note that while the code attempts to validate and sanitize the input URL, real-world URL validation can be more complex, and additional measures may be needed based on specific requirements and potential security risks. Always ensure proper input validation and take security precautions, especially when dealing with user-provided data.
