This Python script demonstrates the use of the DES (Data Encryption Standard) algorithm for encrypting and decrypting a user and message. The DES algorithm is used from the `Crypto.Cipher` module provided by the Pycryptodome library. Here's an explanation of the code:

```python
from Crypto.Cipher import DES

# Fill with spaces the user until 8 characters
user = "user    ".encode("utf8")
message = "message ".encode("utf8")

# Key for DES encryption (must be 8 bytes long)
key = 'mycipher'

# Create a DES cipher object with ECB mode
cipher = DES.new(key.encode("utf8"), DES.MODE_ECB)

# Encrypt the username and message
cipher_user = cipher.encrypt(user)
cipher_message = cipher.encrypt(message)

print("Cipher User: " + str(cipher_user))
print("Cipher Message: " + str(cipher_message))

# Simulate the server where the messages arrive encrypted
cipher = DES.new(key.encode("utf8"), DES.MODE_ECB)

# Decrypt the username and message
decipher_user = cipher.decrypt(cipher_user)
decipher_message = cipher.decrypt(cipher_message)

print("Decipher User: " + str(decipher_user.decode()))
print("Decipher Message: " + str(decipher_message.decode()))
```

Explanation:

1. **Padding:**
   - The script begins by encoding the `user` and `message` strings in UTF-8 and ensuring the `user` string is 8 characters long by filling it with spaces.

2. **Key:**
   - The variable `key` is set to 'mycipher', which is used as the encryption key. Note that for DES, the key must be 8 bytes long.

3. **Cipher Object:**
   - A DES cipher object is created using the ECB (Electronic Codebook) mode with the specified key.

4. **Encryption:**
   - The `encrypt` method is used to encrypt the `user` and `message` strings separately.

5. **Print Encrypted Values:**
   - The encrypted values (`cipher_user` and `cipher_message`) are printed.

6. **Server Simulation:**
   - The script simulates a server where the encrypted messages arrive. Another DES cipher object is created for decryption.

7. **Decryption:**
   - The `decrypt` method is used to decrypt the received encrypted `user` and `message`.

8. **Print Decrypted Values:**
   - The decrypted values (`decipher_user` and `decipher_message`) are printed.

Keep in mind that DES is considered insecure for many applications due to its short key length. For stronger security, consider using a more modern algorithm like AES with a longer key length. Additionally, using modes other than ECB (Electronic Codebook) may provide better security in practical applications.
