**CVE-2021-33503 (ReDoS via Regular Expression Backtracking):**

- **Affected versions:** Prior to 1.26.5
- **Description:** A specially crafted URL with numerous "@" characters in the authority component could trigger catastrophic backtracking in the regular expression used to parse URLs, leading to excessive CPU consumption and potential DoS.
- **Fix:** Upgrade to urllib3 version 1.26.5 or later.

**CVE-2020-7212 (DoS via Inefficient URL Encoding Handling):**

- **Affected versions:** 1.25.2 through 1.25.7
- **Description:** The `_encode_invalid_chars` function in `urllib3` had an inefficient algorithm, potentially leading to DoS attacks by constructing URLs that trigger excessive CPU consumption.
- **Fix:** Upgrade to urllib3 version 1.25.8 or later.

**General Mitigation Strategies:**

- **Upgrade urllib3:** Always use the latest available version to benefit from security fixes.
- **Input Validation:** Sanitize and validate user-provided URLs to prevent injection of malicious patterns.
- **Resource Monitoring:** Implement resource monitoring to detect and respond to excessive CPU usage or other abnormal behavior.
- **Input Rate Limiting:** Consider implementing rate-limiting mechanisms to mitigate potential DoS attacks.

**Additional Considerations:**

- **Stay Informed:** Keep abreast of security advisories related to urllib3 and other Python libraries.
- **Security Best Practices:** Adhere to general security best practices, such as input validation, authentication, and authorization.
