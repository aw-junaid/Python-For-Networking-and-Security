### Purpose of the Code
The provided Python script is a simple UDP server that listens for incoming datagrams, responds to the sender with an acknowledgment, and then sends a platform-specific response to the client.

### Import Statements
```python
import socket
import sys
```
1. **Socket Module:** Provides low-level networking functionality.
2. **sys Module:** Provides access to some variables used or maintained by the interpreter.

### Server Configuration
```python
SERVER_IP = "127.0.0.1"
SERVER_PORT = 6789
```
- **Server IP and Port Configuration:** Specifies the IP address and port on which the server will listen for incoming datagrams.

### Socket Creation and Binding
```python
socket_server = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
socket_server.bind((SERVER_IP, SERVER_PORT))
```
1. **Socket Creation:** Creates a socket for IPv4 (AF_INET) and UDP (SOCK_DGRAM) communication.
2. **Binding:** Binds the socket to the specified IP address and port.

### Server Initialization
```python
print("[*] Server UDP Listening on %s:%d" % (SERVER_IP, SERVER_PORT))
```
- **Print Information:** Prints that the UDP server is listening on a specific IP and port.

### Data Reception and Response Loop
```python
while True:
    data, address = socket_server.recvfrom(4096)
    socket_server.sendto("I am the server accepting connections...".encode(), address)
    data = data.strip()
    print("Message %s received from %s: " % (data, address))
```
1. **Data Reception:** Listens for incoming datagrams using `recvfrom`.
2. **Acknowledgment Response:** Sends an acknowledgment message to the client using `sendto`.
3. **Prints Received Message:** Prints the received message and the address of the sender.

### Response Generation
```python
    try:
        response = "Hi %s" % sys.platform
    except Exception as e:
        response = "%s" % sys.exc_info()[0]
```
- **Response Generation:** Attempts to generate a response indicating the platform the server is running on. If an exception occurs, it captures the exception information.

### Sending Response
```python
    print("Response", response)
    socket_server.sendto(bytes(response, encoding='utf8'), address)
```
- **Response Printing:** Prints the generated response.
- **Sending Response:** Sends the response back to the client using `sendto`.

### Infinite Loop (Server Continuity)
```python
socket_server.close()
```
- **Infinite Loop:** The server remains in an infinite loop to continuously receive and respond to incoming datagrams.
- **Socket Closure:** The `socket_server` socket is closed (Note: this line is unreachable due to the infinite loop, and it's recommended to remove it or place it in an appropriate condition for graceful termination).

### Summary
This script implements a UDP server that listens for datagrams, acknowledges the sender, and generates a response based on the server's platform. The server continues to run indefinitely in a loop, continuously handling incoming datagrams.
