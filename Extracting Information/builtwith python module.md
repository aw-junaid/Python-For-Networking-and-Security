It seems there might be a slight confusion. The "BuiltWith" service is typically associated with web technologies and is not directly related to a Python module named "builtwith." However, I'll provide information on both:

1. **BuiltWith Service:**
   - [BuiltWith](https://builtwith.com/) is a web service that allows you to discover the technologies used on websites. It provides insights into the web hosting, content delivery networks (CDNs), analytics, advertising, and other technologies implemented by a website.

2. **BuiltWith Python Module:**
   - The `builtwith` Python module is a tool that allows you to use the BuiltWith service programmatically. It can be used to retrieve information about the technologies employed by a particular website.

Here's a basic example of how you can use the `builtwith` Python module:

```python
import builtwith

# Specify the website URL
website_url = "https://example.com"

# Use builtwith to retrieve technology information
result = builtwith.lookup(website_url)

# Print the result
print(result)
```

This script will print a dictionary containing information about the technologies used by the specified website. The `builtwith` module can be installed using:

```bash
pip install builtwith
```

Please note that while using web scraping tools and services, it's important to respect the terms of service of the websites you interact with and ensure compliance with legal and ethical considerations.
