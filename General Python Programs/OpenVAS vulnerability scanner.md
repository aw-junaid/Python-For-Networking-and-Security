OpenVAS (Open Vulnerability Assessment System) is an open-source vulnerability scanning tool that is often used for identifying security issues in systems and networks. While OpenVAS itself is not written in Python, there are Python libraries and tools that can be used to interact with OpenVAS.

One such tool is `pyvas`, which is a Python library for interacting with the OpenVAS Manager. Here's a simple example of how to use `pyvas`:

### Install `pyvas`

You can install `pyvas` using pip:

```bash
pip install pyvas
```

### Example Usage

```python
from pyvas import Scanner

# Replace these with your OpenVAS Manager information
OPENVAS_HOST = 'your-openvas-host'
OPENVAS_USER = 'your-openvas-username'
OPENVAS_PASSWORD = 'your-openvas-password'

# Connect to OpenVAS Manager
scanner = Scanner(OPENVAS_HOST, OPENVAS_USER, OPENVAS_PASSWORD)

# Example: Get a list of all tasks
tasks = scanner.get_tasks()
for task in tasks:
    print(f"Task ID: {task.id}, Name: {task.name}")
```

### Important Notes:

1. Replace `'your-openvas-host'`, `'your-openvas-username'`, and `'your-openvas-password'` with your actual OpenVAS Manager information.

2. Ensure you have the necessary permissions and have set up the OpenVAS Manager correctly.

3. This example uses `pyvas` for interacting with the OpenVAS Manager. Depending on your specific needs, you may need to use different tools or libraries.

4. Always handle your credentials securely and avoid hardcoding them in your scripts.

Remember to consult the official documentation of the library or tool you are using for more detailed information and additional features. Additionally, ensure that your usage of OpenVAS or any other security tool complies with legal and ethical standards, and you have the appropriate authorization to perform vulnerability scanning.
