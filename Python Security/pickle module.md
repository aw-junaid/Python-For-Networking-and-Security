The code you provided demonstrates a security vulnerability related to the `pickle` module. Let's break down the code and explain the security issue:

```python
import os
import pickle

class Vulnerable(object):
    def __reduce__(self):
        # Note: this will only list files in your directory.
        return (os.system, ('ls',))

def serialize_exploit():
    shellcode = pickle.dumps(Vulnerable())
    return shellcode

def insecure_deserialize(exploit_code):
    pickle.loads(exploit_code)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    shellcode = serialize_exploit()
    print('Obtaining files...')
    insecure_deserialize(shellcode)
```

1. **`Vulnerable` Class:**
   - The `Vulnerable` class is defined with a `__reduce__` method. This method is a special method used by the `pickle` module for customization during object serialization and deserialization.

2. **`__reduce__` Method:**
   - The `__reduce__` method is overridden in the `Vulnerable` class to return a tuple `(os.system, ('ls',))`. This means that when an instance of `Vulnerable` is pickled and later unpickled, it will execute the `os.system('ls')` command, listing the files in the current directory.

3. **`serialize_exploit` Function:**
   - The `serialize_exploit` function uses `pickle.dumps` to serialize an instance of the `Vulnerable` class. This results in a serialized representation of the object containing the `__reduce__` method.

4. **`insecure_deserialize` Function:**
   - The `insecure_deserialize` function uses `pickle.loads` to deserialize the provided data. Since the serialized data comes from an instance of `Vulnerable` with a malicious `__reduce__` method, it executes the `os.system('ls')` command upon deserialization.

5. **`if __name__ == '__main__':` Block:**
   - In the main block, the `serialize_exploit` function is called to obtain the serialized shellcode. The shellcode is then deserialized using the `insecure_deserialize` function, resulting in the execution of the `os.system('ls')` command.

### Security Issue:

The code demonstrates a classic example of a security vulnerability known as arbitrary code execution during deserialization. The use of `__reduce__` in the `Vulnerable` class allows an attacker to inject arbitrary code that gets executed when the object is deserialized.

### Mitigation:

To prevent such vulnerabilities:

- **Avoid Using `__reduce__`:** Avoid defining `__reduce__` methods unless absolutely necessary, especially in classes that might be serialized and deserialized from untrusted sources.

- **Sanitize and Validate Input:** When using `pickle` or similar serialization libraries, ensure that the data being deserialized is from a trusted source. Validate and sanitize input to prevent code injection.

- **Use Safe Deserialization Methods:** If you need to deserialize data, consider using safer alternatives such as JSON or YAML, or use methods like `ast.literal_eval()` or `yaml.safe_load()`.

- **Restrict Permissions:** When dealing with serialization or deserialization, restrict permissions appropriately to minimize the impact of potential attacks.

In general, it's important to be cautious when using serialization and deserialization, especially when dealing with untrusted input. Avoiding potentially dangerous features like `__reduce__` and validating user input are essential practices for writing secure code.
