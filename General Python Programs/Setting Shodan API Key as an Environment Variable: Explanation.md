### **Setting Shodan API Key as an Environment Variable: Explanation**

This Python script demonstrates how to set the Shodan API key as an environment variable for use in other scripts.

### **1. Importing the Required Module:**
```python
import os
```
The script imports the `os` library for handling environment variables.

### **2. Setting the Shodan API Key as an Environment Variable:**
```python
# Set the Shodan API key as an environment variable
os.environ['SHODAN_API_KEY'] = 'SET_YOUR_OWN_API_KEY'
```
The Shodan API key is set as an environment variable using `os.environ['SHODAN_API_KEY']`. Make sure to replace `'SET_YOUR_OWN_API_KEY'` with your actual Shodan API key.

### **3. Verifying the Environment Variable:**
```python
# Verify that the environment variable is set correctly
if 'SHODAN_API_KEY' not in os.environ:
    print("Error: SHODAN_API_KEY environment variable not set.")
    exit(1)
```
The script checks if the environment variable `'SHODAN_API_KEY'` is set. If not, it prints an error message and exits with code 1.

### **4. Success Message:**
```python
print("SHODAN_API_KEY environment variable set successfully.")
```
If the environment variable is set correctly, the script prints a success message.

### **Explanation Summary:**
- The script sets the Shodan API key as an environment variable using `os.environ['SHODAN_API_KEY']`.
- It checks whether the environment variable is set correctly and prints an error message if not.
- If the variable is set successfully, it prints a success message.

### **Note:**
Before running this script, make sure to replace `'SET_YOUR_OWN_API_KEY'` with your actual Shodan API key. This script is typically run once to set the environment variable for use in other scripts.
