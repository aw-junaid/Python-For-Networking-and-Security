### Code Explanation: Asynchronous GET Request with `httpx`

Let's break down the provided Python code that uses the `httpx` library to make an asynchronous GET request to "http://www.google.es" and prints information about the response.

### Importing the `httpx` Library and `asyncio` Module
```python
import httpx
import asyncio
```
- **Import Statements:**
  - Imports the `httpx` library for making HTTP requests.
  - Imports the `asyncio` module for handling asynchronous operations.

### Defining an Asynchronous Function
```python
async def request_http1():
```
- **Asynchronous Function:**
  - Defines an asynchronous function named `request_http1` using the `async def` syntax.

### Creating an `httpx` AsyncClient and Making an Asynchronous GET Request
```python
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.get("http://www.google.es")
```
- **Creating an `httpx` AsyncClient:**
  - Uses `httpx.AsyncClient` to create an asynchronous HTTP client within an `async with` context.
  - Makes an asynchronous GET request to "http://www.google.es" using `await client.get()` and stores the response in the `response` variable.

### Printing the Response Object and Text
```python
        print(response)
        print(response.text)
```
- **Printing Response Information:**
  - Prints the entire `httpx.Response` object, which includes information about the HTTP response.
  - Prints the content of the HTTP response as text.

### Printing the HTTP Version
```python
        print(response.http_version)
```
- **Printing HTTP Version:**
  - Prints the HTTP version used in the response (e.g., "HTTP/1.1" or "HTTP/2").

### Running the Asynchronous Function
```python
asyncio.run(request_http1())
```
- **Running the Asynchronous Function:**
  - Uses `asyncio.run` to run the asynchronous function `request_http1()`.

### Summary
The provided code demonstrates making an asynchronous GET request to "http://www.google.es" using the `httpx` library. The use of the `async with` statement and `await` keyword allows for asynchronous handling of the HTTP request. The code prints information about the HTTP response, including the response object, response text, and the HTTP version used. The entire asynchronous operation is executed using `asyncio.run()`.
