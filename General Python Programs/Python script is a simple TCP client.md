### Purpose of the Code
The provided Python script is a simple TCP client that connects to a server using sockets. It establishes a connection, sends and receives messages to and from the server, and handles a "quit" command to gracefully terminate the communication.

### Import Statement
```python
import socket
```
- **Import Statement:** Imports the `socket` module for socket operations.

### Configuration Parameters
```python
host = "127.0.0.1"
port = 9998
```
- **Host and Port Configuration:** Specifies the target host (server) and port to connect to.

### Connection Setup and Message Reception
```python
try:
    mysocket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    mysocket.connect((host, port))
    print('Connected to host ' + str(host) + ' in port: ' + str(port))
    message = mysocket.recv(1024)
    print("Message received from the server", message)
```
1. **Socket Creation:** Creates a socket for IPv4 (AF_INET) and TCP (SOCK_STREAM) communication.
2. **Connection Establishment:** Connects to the specified host and port.
3. **Connection Confirmation:** Prints a message indicating successful connection.
4. **Message Reception:** Receives an initial message from the server.

### Message Sending Loop
```python
    while True:
        message = input("Enter your message > ")
        mysocket.send(bytes(message.encode('utf-8')))
        if message == "quit":
            break
```
1. **Infinite Loop:** Prompts the user to enter a message and sends it to the server using the `send` method.
2. **Quit Condition:** If the entered message is "quit," the loop is exited.

### Socket Error Handling
```python
except socket.errno as error:
    print("Socket error ", error)
```
- **Exception Handling:** Catches socket-related errors and prints an error message.

### Socket Closure
```python
finally:
    mysocket.close()
```
- **Socket Closure:** Ensures that the socket is closed, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.

### Summary
This script establishes a TCP connection to a server, receives an initial message, enters an interactive loop to send messages to the server, and terminates when the user enters "quit." It includes error handling for potential socket errors and ensures proper socket closure in the `finally` block.
