## Network Forensics With PcapXray

PcapXray is a powerful open-source network forensics tool that allows you to analyze captured network traffic (PCAP files) offline. It provides a variety of features to help you investigate security incidents, troubleshoot network issues, and gain insights into network activity.

**Here are some of the key capabilities of PcapXray:**

* **Network Diagram Visualization:** PcapXray automatically generates a network diagram based on the captured traffic. This diagram shows the relationships between devices on the network, the type and volume of traffic flowing between them, and other key information.

* **Device and Traffic Analysis:** PcapXray provides detailed information about the devices and protocols involved in the captured traffic. You can view the IP addresses, hostnames, MAC addresses, and operating systems of the devices, as well as the types of protocols (e.g., TCP, UDP, HTTP, DNS) being used.
* **Malicious Traffic Identification:** PcapXray can help you identify potentially malicious traffic based on a variety of criteria, such as known indicators of compromise (IOCs) and suspicious behavior. This can help you quickly zero in on potential threats and take appropriate action.
* **File Extraction:** PcapXray can extract files that were transferred over the network during the capture. This can be helpful for recovering evidence of malware or other malicious activity.
* **Web Traffic Analysis:** PcapXray can provide detailed information about web traffic, such as the URLs that were accessed, the user agents that were used, and the cookies that were exchanged. This can be helpful for investigating web-based attacks or troubleshooting web application issues.

**Overall, PcapXray is a valuable tool for anyone who needs to analyze network traffic. It is easy to use, even for those with limited network forensics experience, and it can provide a wealth of insights into network activity.**
